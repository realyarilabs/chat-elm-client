# Contributing to the core libraries

Thanks helping with the development of Elm client for Yari.chat! This document describes the basic
standards for opening pull requests and making the review process as smooth as
possible.

## Ground rules

  * Always make pull requests minimal. If it can be split up, it should be split up.
  * Use style consistent with the file you are modifying.
  * Document all functions [See examples](http://package.elm-lang.org/help/documentation-format).
  * Use descriptive titles for MRs
  * Provide all the necessary context for evaluation in the MR.
    If there are relevant issues or examples or discussions, add them.
    If things can be summarized, summarize them. The easiest MRs are ones
    that already address the reviewers questions and concerns.

## Documentation Fixes

If you want to fix docs, just open a MR. This is super helpful!

## Bug Fixes

If you find an issue or see one you want to work on, go for it!

The best strategy is often to dive in. Asking for directions usually
does not work. If someone knew the specifics and knew how how to fix
it, it is likely they would have already sent the MR themselves!

Also, be sure you are testing.

## Structure of code.

  * We are fairly conservative about change the files structure to the core Elm client.
    - See README file for more info.
  * See [Elm arquitecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).
  * see [Api guide lines](http://package.elm-lang.org/help/design-guidelines).
